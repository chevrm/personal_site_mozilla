research: Research Summary
researchsum: Bacteria, especially actinomycetes, have a reputation for biosynthesizing chemicals that are of high clinical or biotechnological value. Over half of the drugs approved by the FDA in the past decade are of natural origin or are synthetically derived from natural scaffolds. I'm interested in a) developing computational tools to mine genome data from these bacteria to find novel biosynthetic gene clusters and predict their chemical products, b) understanding the evolutionary histories and trajectories of these compounds to inform discovery stradegies, and c) developing methods of engineering the gene content of these clusters towards generating even more chemical diversity.</p><p>Until recently, I was the Head of Experimental Genomics at <a href='http://www.warpdrivebio.com'>Warp Drive Bio</a>, which has built the largest bacterial genome database in history to exploit gene cluster diversity for the discovery of novel therapeutics and exciting biosynthesis. I joined <a href='http://www.genetics.wisc.edu/'>UW-Madison Genetics</a> in 2015 as a member of <a href='http://currielab.wisc.edu/'>Cameron Currie's lab</a> to continue my research on specialized metabolites, their role in nature, and the possibility of enrichment for novel compounds of therapeutic use. As a <a href='https://biochem.wisc.edu/cbit'>Chemistry-Biology Interface</a> Predoctoral Fellow, I take an evolutionary approach to probe the chemical diversity of polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters in many systems, including our model system of symbiosis.</p><p>Working towards an understanding of the evolutionary underpinnings of natural product biosynthesis has two major consequences. First, it offers a rational prioritization framework for isolation of strains enriched in novel biosynthetic potential. Second, it leads to testable hypotheses about the natural roles of natural products. Uncovering the role these molecules play in mediating ecological interations will offer huge insights for optimizing natural product drug discovery.</p><p>The model system to study this phenomenon in the <a href='http://currielab.wisc.edu/'>Currie Lab</a> is nothing short of fascinating. Certain ants are farmers. These ants farm (and later eat) a fungus, which is highly rich in nutrients. Like human farmers, the ants have been faced with the challenge of pathogenic decimation of their "crop". To circumvent this challenge, millions of years of coevolution has resulted in a symbiotic relationship between the ants and actinomycete bacteria that coat their bodies. These bacteria can synthesize chemical compounds that protect against bad, nasty organisms trying to steal the ant's food. Today, the actinobacterial strains that coat these ants are specific to a given colony.</p><center><figure><img src="img/mut.jpg" alt="Leaf-Cutter System"><figcaption><font size="3">Photo: Currie Lab</font></figcaption></figure></center><p>These bacteria are both highly prolific in specialized metabolite capability and are variable in their biosynthetic gene cluster content over space and evolutionary time. Our hypothesis is that not only can these actinomycetes provide antibiotic and antifungal protection of the ant's cultivar, they may be a prolific discovery avenue for compounds of human therapeutic and biotechnological use. Furthermore, this is an ideal system to study the coevolution of interaction specificity between the invading pathogen(s) and the actinobacteria.</p><center><figure><img src="img/struct.jpg" alt="Structures and Activities of Insect-associated Compounds"><figcaption><font size="3">Photo: Currie Lab</font></figcaption></figure></center><p>The likelihood of a gene cluster under high selective pressure to hit a eukaryotically conserved target (and thus a medically relevant target) is relatively high when you consider that millions of years of selective evolution are on our side. Nature is spending a lot of energy to make these
molecules, so it follows that they must be making them for a biological reason. In a variety of collaborations we hope to prove exactly this while uncovering the evolutionary mechanisms of biosynthesis. Ecological- and evolutionary-minded investigations of these and other actinomycetes promise exciting avenues for therapeutic discovery and uncovering the evolutionary mechanisms of biosynthesis.</p>
